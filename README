This repo serves as a bootloader and interface for Lua programs on the RP2040. It also includes a file system for requiring and loading files from flash (See [littlefs] (https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs)).

A 'init.lua' file must be present under files/ in order to boot. The files are then built into the executable.
